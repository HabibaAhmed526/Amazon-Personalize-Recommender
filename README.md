# 🎯 Amazon Personalize Recommender System 

The project involves building a simple recommendation system using **Amazon Personalize** with a real dataset, and generating recommendations for sample users.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Prepare and upload a dataset of user-item interactions.
- Train a recommender model using **Amazon Personalize**.
- Generate personalized recommendations for selected users.
- Document all steps, decisions, and results.
- (Bonus) Provide a deployment plan to integrate recommendations into an application.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Amazon Personalize**
- **Amazon S3**
- **IAM Roles**
- **MovieLens 100K Dataset**
- **Python / Pandas**

---

## 📂 Dataset Preparation

- Dataset used: **MovieLens 100K**
- I extracted a sample of **1,000 rows** from the original dataset to simplify processing and reduce training time.
- The `u.data` file was converted into a CSV named `interactions_sample.csv`.
- A new column `event_type` with the value `"watch"` was added to each row to comply with schema requirements.

**Final CSV Columns:**

```text
user_id,item_id,timestamp,event_type
```

## 🧱 Amazon Personalize Setup

1. **Created a Dataset Group**: `movie-recommender-habiba`
2. **Created a Schema**:

```json
{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "Interactions",
  "namespace": "com.amazonaws.personalize.schema",
  "fields": [
    { "name": "user_id", "type": "string" },
    { "name": "item_id", "type": "string" },
    { "name": "timestamp", "type": "long" },
    { "name": "event_type", "type": "string" }
  ],
  "version": "1.0"
}
```

3. **Uploaded the CSV to S3** and configured:
   - IAM Role with `AmazonPersonalizeFullAccess`
   - S3 bucket policy to allow access

4. **Imported the dataset** into Amazon Personalize successfully.

## 🤖 Model Training & Recommendations

- Used the **"Top Picks for You"** recommender.
- Training was performed using the **User-Personalization** recipe.
- After training, I generated recommendations for multiple users from the dataset.

### 🔍 Sample Output for `user_id = 102`:

| Item ID | Score     |
|---------|-----------|
| 234     | 0.00861   |
| 274     | 0.00647   |
| 25      | 0.00642   |
| ...     | ...       |

> Scores reflect the relevance of each item to the specific user.

## 🚀 Deployment Plan (Bonus)

If deployed in a real-world application:

- Build a backend using **FastAPI** or **Flask** to call the Personalize `GetRecommendations` API using **boto3**.
- Display recommended items in a web interface (e.g., Streamlit or React).
- Update real-time interaction data via **Event Trackers**.
- Schedule regular retraining pipelines using **AWS Lambda** or **Step Functions**.
- Monitor usage and performance using **CloudWatch**.
- Secure with appropriate **IAM roles** and **policies**.

## 🧹 Cleanup

- All Personalize resources (dataset group, schema, dataset, recommender) were **deleted** after the task to prevent charges, as per AWS guidelines.
